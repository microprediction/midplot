    "# En garde, attack!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Mid+One! Dive into the world of martingales and market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge: spot tiny shifts in financial time-series, to predict where prices are heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's all about spotting patterns in the elusive mid-price.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attacking not forecasting!\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want to forecast the future prices as this is extremely difficult and requires often a lot of computation. What we want is detect a shift in the market dynamics, up or down, that's it! \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a much simpler task and can be done with a simple model. We also need this decision to be computed quickly! Under 20 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be precise, our attacker will consume a univariate sequence of numerical data points $x_1, x_2, \\dots x_t$ and try to exploit deviations from the [martingale property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)), which is to say that we expect the series $x_t$ to satisfy:\n",
    "$$ E[x_{t+k}] \\approx x_t $$\n",
    "roughly. Of course, there's no such thing in this world as a perfect martingale and it is your job to indicate when\n",
    "$$ E[x_{t+k}] > x_t + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "by returning a positive value, or conversely. Here $\\epsilon$ finds interpretation as a trading cost. The attacker will *typically* return `0` meaning that it thinks:\n",
    "$$  x_t - \\epsilon   > E[x_{t+k}] > x_t + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "because trading opportunities are probably on the rare side - though obviously this is problem dependent. The $\\epsilon$ and $k$ (`horizon`) parameters are set [here](https://github.com/microprediction/midone/blob/main/midone/gameconfig.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring is straightforward: it corresponds to the profit of a simple trading strategy: if the model predicts a move up over some short horizon (corresponding to a few seconds at most), the strategy is to buy now and sell at the end of the horizon minus some transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decided to go up at $t$:\n",
    "$$x_{t+k} - x_t - \\epsilon$$\n",
    "and \n",
    "$$x_t - x_{t+k} - \\epsilon$$\n",
    "if we decided to go down at $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of a move down is symmetric. In most cases, we don't expect the model to predict a move up or down so we will just do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of detecting three move ups (the green bands, detecting down would show as red bands), with two resulting in a profit and one with a loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Profit](docs/profit.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "# The data\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition is really meant to focus on single streaming series and should be quite agnostic to particular financial instruments. There is a training phase where parameters can be learned on group of similar instruments but overall, we rely on online learning. \n",
